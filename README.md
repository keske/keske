# Hi, I’m Andrey 👋

Applied **AI Engineer** with a strong full-stack background, focused on building
**production-grade RAG and LLM systems**.

I work at the intersection of:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings & semantic search
- Backend systems & APIs
- Product-focused AI engineering

---

## What I’m working on

- Designing end-to-end RAG systems for large document collections
- Building ingestion, chunking, and embedding pipelines
- Semantic & hybrid retrieval with citation-aware context assembly
- Streaming LLM responses integrated into real products
- Making RAG systems observable, tunable, and maintainable

---

## Tech focus

- **LLMs & RAG:** OpenAI-compatible APIs, local models
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Node.js
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, vector databases (Qdrant / FAISS)
- **Infra:** background workers, async pipelines
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js (when product UX matters)

---

## Philosophy

> RAG is a system, not a prompt.  
> Data quality beats clever prompting.  
> Production constraints shape good AI.

---

## Selected projects

- 🧠 **RAG Platform** — production-oriented retrieval system for unstructured data  
- 🛠 **Observer** — AI-native tooling for working with complex data flows  
- 📦 OSS libraries used in production products
